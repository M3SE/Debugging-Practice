# Debugging-Practice

## Instructions:
- Write a Java method that calculates the average of an array of integers. This method should take an array of integers as input and return a double as output.

- Test your method with an array containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Your method should return 3.0.

- If your method does not work correctly, use System.out.println() statements and/or a debugger to find and fix the problem. Note down what the problem was and how you fixed it.

- Introduce a null pointer exception and an array index out of bounds exception into your program. Note down the line numbers where these exceptions occur.

- Use a debugger to find and fix these exceptions. Note down how you used the debugger to find the problems.

- Finally, introduce a logic error into your program (an error where the program runs, but produces incorrect output). Note down the line number where this error occurs.

- Use a debugger to find and fix this logic error. Note down how you used the debugger to find the problem.
